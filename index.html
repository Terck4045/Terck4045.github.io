  <p>Skydiving, also called parachuting, is a sport in which athletes jump out of an airplane at a certain altitude and perform acrobatic movements in free fall. Then they open their parachutes to slow down and return safely to Earth. Skydiving is considered to be an extreme sport which takes a lot of courage but also gives you an adrenalin kick.</p><center>

<p>Skydiving is a sport that is not as young as it may seem.  At the end of the 18th century, a Frenchman, Andre Garnerin, jumped from a hot air balloon and was thought to be the first real parachutist.
Later on skydiving became important for the army and air force. Pilots could jump out of a plane and land on earth safely if something went wrong. In wars soldiers were dropped off in war zones, often behind enemy lines. Skydivers are also used when it comes to fighting off disasters like bush fires.</p>

<p>Competitions in skydiving are held regularly.  Events include landing close to a target and performing acrobatic movements in the air, as well as flying in formation. In the last few years another event, sky surfing, in which a surfboard is attached to a jumper, has become popular. Group skydiving requires a group of parachutists to perform figures while in free fall.</p>

<p>Costs in the sport are not trivial. As new technological advances or performance enhancements are introduced, equipment tends to increase in price. Similarly, the average skydiver carries more equipment than in earlier years, with safety devices (such as an AAD) contributing to a significant portion of the cost.
A full set of brand-new equipment can easily cost as much as a new motorcycle or half a small car. The market is not large enough to permit the steady lowering of prices that is seen with some other equipment like computers.<br>
A new main canopy for the experienced parachutist can cost between $2,000 and $3,000 US. Higher performance and Tandem Parachutes cost significantly more, whilst large docile student parachutes often cost less.</p>

<p>Despite the perception of danger, fatalities are rare. About 21 skydivers are confirmed killed each year in the US, roughly one death for every 150,000 jumps (about 0.0007%).
In the US and in most of the western world, skydivers are required to carry two parachutes. The reserve parachute must be periodically inspected and re-packed (whether used or not) by a certified parachute rigger (in the US, an FAA certificated parachute rigger). Many skydivers use an automatic activation device (AAD) that opens the reserve parachute at a pre-determined altitude if it detects that the skydiver is still in free fall. Depending on the country, AADs are often mandatory for new jumpers, and/or required for all jumpers regardless of their experience level. Most skydivers wear a visual altimeter, and an increasing number also use audible altimeters fitted to their helmets.<br>Skydiving equipment can be bought trought the following page <a href="http://www.skydivestore.com/">www.skydivestore.com/</a></p>
